### ActiveEntry Configuration

````js

if(Meteor.isClient){
  ActiveEntry.configure({
    logo: {
      url: "/mini-circles.png",
      displayed: true
    },
    signIn: {
      displayFullName: true,
      destination: "/table/users"
    },
    signUp: {
      destination: "/table/users"
    },
    themeColors: {
      primary: ""
    }
  });
}

if(Meteor.isServer){
  Accounts.emailTemplates.siteName = "AwesomeSite";
  Accounts.emailTemplates.from = "AwesomeSite Admin <accounts@example.com>";
  Accounts.emailTemplates.enrollAccount.subject = function (user) {
      return "Welcome to Awesome Town, " + user.profile.name;
  };
  Accounts.emailTemplates.enrollAccount.text = function (user, url) {
     return "You have been selected to participate in building a better future!"
       + " To activate your account, simply click the link below:\n\n"
       + url;
  };  

  Meteor.startup(function(){
    process.env.MAIL_URL = 'smtp://sandboxid.mailgun.org:mypassword@smtp.mailgun.org:587';
  })  
}
````
Alternatively, you may want to set the ``MAIL_URL`` via an external environment variable, particularly if you're using a SaaS hosting provider.

````sh
MAIL_URL = 'smtp://sandboxid.mailgun.org:mypassword@smtp.mailgun.org:587' meteor
````
