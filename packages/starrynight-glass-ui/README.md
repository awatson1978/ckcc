glass:glass-ui
===============================

Generally inspried by the [Day Made of Glass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzLYh3j6xn8) videos.  Currently, this package only contains a ``.less`` stylesheet that's focused on haptics (big buttons), multi-device accessibility (media states), and transparency effects.  


==================================
#### Architectural Roadmap

This is going to become a meta-package, and incorporate a number of other animation packages.  We're currently looking at the following packages to add into the Glass UI.  


  glass:glass-ui
    grigio:babel
    animate.js
    mrt:jquery-easing
    glass:jss
    percolate:momentum
    gadicohen:famous-views
    particle4dev:famous-flex
    pierreeric:fview-flexgrid
    wenape:fview-infinitescrollview
    pierreeric:fview-sliddeck
    pierreeric:fview-kenburns
    oorabona:fview-boxlayout


  glass:card-ui
    peerlibrary:blaze-components / react
-   aldeed:template-extensions
    numtel:web-components


==================================
#### Google Glass

There's a slight API conflict with the Google Glass project.  I'd be perfectly willing to consider adding Google Glass APIs, and to consider this package as a sort of generalized 'Augmented Reality UI'.  Just be aware that even though it's called 'Glass UI', it's originally focused on Day Made of Glass UI, rather than Google Glass UI.
